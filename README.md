# Levels of Football Analytics Project

This project aims to analyze and compare high school, college, and NFL football statistics to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights across the different levels of play. The primary focus is on understanding what distinguishes each level and identifying meaningful trends within the game.

## To-Do List

- [x] **Task 1**: Finding data sources (Bound, Kaggle, Pro Football Reference)
- [x] **Task 2**: Clean and preprocess the data for analysis
- [x] **Task 3**: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and extract insights
- [x] **Task 4**: Visualize findings and present results effectively

## Project Goals

1. Analyze the differences in scoring, yardage, and win percentages between high school, college, and NFL football.
2. Investigate correlations by region, level, and conference to uncover trends in offensive and defensive strategies.
3. Provide actionable insights for high school players in Iowa looking to pursue opportunities in college football.
4. Understand how offensive styles (rushing vs. passing) vary by level and region.

## Data Sources

1. **High School Football**: Scraped from Bound, focusing on Iowa high school teams.
2. **College Football**: 2023 season dataset from Kaggle, representing NCAA football statistics.
3. **NFL Football**: 2023 season data from Pro Football Reference.

## Key Metrics Analyzed

- **Points per game (ppg)**: Offensive production
- **Points allowed per game (ppg_a)**: Defensive performance
- **Yards per game (ypg)**: Total offensive yardage
- **Touchdowns (off_tds, rush_tds, pass_tds)**: Scoring breakdown
- **Win percentage (win_pct)**: Team success rate

## Limitations and Future Work

- Analysis is based on a single season of data for each level. Future iterations may include multi-year datasets to identify trends over time.
- Geographic, coaching, and economic factors affecting team performance are not included in the scope of this project.
- Advanced statistical models (e.g., regression, clustering) can be explored in future analyses to deepen insights.
